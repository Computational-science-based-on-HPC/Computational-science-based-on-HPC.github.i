  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><strong>libphysics</strong> is a physics library that simulates various physics calculations as parallelized and serialized implementations to obtain optimal performance and results.</p>

  <h2>Simulations</h2>
  <h3>1. Damped spring motion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Damped Spring Motion is a simple harmonic motion that simulates the motion of a mass attached to a spring and oscillates in a y-axis direction with given parameters that the user specifies like mass and stiffness of the spring.</li>
    <li>This simulation is implemented in both parallel and serial implementations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. Elastic Pendulum</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Elastic pendulum/pendulum spring/swinging spring system is a system where it simulates the motion of 2D-spring in both directions y-axis and x-axis = given parameters that the user specifies like mass and stiffness of the spring.</li>
    <li>Due to the chaotic motion of this system and its dependencies, its algorithm is implemented in the serial algorithm only.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. 1D Heat Equation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Heat Equation is an equation where it simulates the change of heat in a body isolated from the outer world and isn't affected by any other heat or cooling source.</li>
    <li>In this simulation, we simulate heat propagation in a 1D body as a wire and the change in its temperature over time using Fourier transform.</li>
    <li>This simulation is implemented as a serial and parallel program.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4. 2D Heat Equation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Heat Equation is an equation where it simulates the change of heat in a body isolated from the outer world and isn't affected by any other heat or cooling source.</li>
    <li>In this simulation, we simulate heat propagation in a 2D body as a CPU as a square or rectangle and the change in its temperature over time using Fourier transform.</li>
    <li>This simulation is implemented as a serial and parallel program.</li>
  </ul>
